Tayko is a software catalog firm that sells games and educational software. It recently put together a revised collection of items in a new catalog, which it is preparing to roll out in a mass mailing. A sample mailing was sent out to test the market. After using this dataset of customers, they want to be able to predict who will be a purchaser from their catalog in order to target the mass mailing.
